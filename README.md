# Page2TEI Export Splitter

This tool is designed to address the bug in Transkribus, as of September/October 2024, which prevents users from exporting only selected pages for the page2tei export file. The Page2TEI Export Splitter provides a workaround for this issue by allowing users to split the export file and extract specific pages using Python and XSLT.

## Usage Instructions

1. Place the file you want to split in the `export_files` folder.

2. Open the `python_processing/splitter.py` file and configure the variables for the metadata. Adjust the range of the pages to be extracted as needed.

3. Run the `splitter.py` script. The output files will be generated in the `output` folder.

4. The XSLT stylesheet located at `xslt/test-stylesheet.xsl` is automatically run by the Python script. This further refines the extracted files, so there's no need to use Oxygen or any other XSLT editor separately.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- The `os` module (should be included in the Python standard library)
- The `lxml` library for processing XML and XSLT

Ensure that you have the necessary modules and libraries installed before using this tool.
